          <h2>What I Bring on My Travels</h2>
          <p>
            There are so many different ways to travel. From jumping in your car
            and just going to taking months to meticulously plan the perfect
            trip, everyone has their favorite recipe for a life-changing
            vacation. It's taken some time, but I feel like I finally have the
            perfect list of what to bring on all of my excursions.

          <h3>Games to Play on the Road</h3>
          <p>
            Traveling with others is always better than traveling alone, in my
            opinion. I don't mind the quiet, but sometimes it's nice to have a
            few activities to keep our minds entertained while driving.

          <h3>Take in the Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            It's easy to run from place to place when in a new country. I'm
            guilty of rushing to the nearest museum as soon as I land. However,
            I've lately found solace in just walking around a new city and
            enjoying the architecture...
